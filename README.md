# Supermarket_Pricing

This kata is about supermarkets prices where some of the prices are simple and other prices are complex.

## For example:

* A can of beans costs $0.65 which is a simple price
* Three items for a dollar and what will be the price if we buy 4 or 5 items? which is complex price
* $1.99/pound and what does 4 ounces cost? which is complex price
* Buy two items and get one free, so what will be the third item price? which is complex price
